## üß± SECTION 3: 4-LAYER PROMPT DESIGN

### üîπ 3.1 INPUT UNDERSTANDING

**Prompt:**
```
You are an educational planning assistant. Create a detailed study plan for ${subject} with the following requirements:

**Study Details:**
- Subject: ${subject}
- Exam date: ${examDate} (${daysUntilExam} days from now)
- Daily study hours available: ${studyHours} hours
- Weak topics to focus on: ${weakTopics || 'Not specified'}

**Instructions:**
- Create a day-by-day study schedule for the next ${Math.min(daysUntilExam - 1, 14)} days
- Each day should have specific topics to study and activities to complete
- Include practice exercises, review sessions, and mock tests
- Make it practical and achievable within the given time constraints
```

**What is this prompt responsible for?**
This prompt handles user input parsing and context understanding, ensuring the AI agent comprehends the specific educational requirements, time constraints, and subject matter before generating personalized study content.

**Example Input + Output:**
- **Input:** Subject: "Calculus", Exam Date: "July 15, 2025", Study Hours: "3", Weak Topics: "Integration by parts"
- **Output:** Structured 14-day study plan with daily topics, specific activities, and time allocations focusing heavily on integration techniques

### üîπ 3.2 STATE TRACKER

**Prompt:**
```javascript
// State management through JavaScript variables and localStorage
const appData = {
    studyPlans: [],
    completedQuizzes: [],
    summarizedNotes: [],
    progressStats: {
        totalStudySessions: 0,
        averageQuizScore: 0,
        topicsStudied: [],
        lastActivity: null
    }
};

// Backend status tracking
let backendStatus = {
    isConnected: false,
    lastChecked: null,
    healthCheckInterval: null
};
```

**How does this help the agent "remember"?**
The state tracker maintains context across user sessions by storing completed activities, quiz scores, and study progress in localStorage. This enables the agent to provide personalized recommendations based on historical performance and track learning patterns over time.

**Did you simulate memory with variables / system messages?**
Yes, we implemented persistent memory through localStorage for client-side data and maintained session state through JavaScript variables. The backend tracks API usage and maintains conversation context for more coherent AI responses across multiple interactions.

### üîπ 3.3 TASK PLANNER

**Prompt:**
```javascript
// Multi-agent task coordination
async function handleStudyPlanGeneration(formData) {
    try {
        // Step 1: Validate inputs and calculate timeline
        const daysUntilExam = calculateDaysUntilExam(formData.examDate);
        
        // Step 2: Construct context-aware prompt
        const prompt = buildStudyPlanPrompt(formData, daysUntilExam);
        
        // Step 3: Send to AI agent via secure backend
        const response = await callBackendAPI(prompt);
        
        // Step 4: Parse and format output
        const parsedPlan = parseStudyPlanResponse(response);
        
        // Step 5: Store in memory and display
        saveStudyPlan(parsedPlan);
        displayStudyPlan(parsedPlan);
    } catch (error) {
        handleFallbackStudyPlan(formData);
    }
}
```

**What steps does your agent take internally to solve the problem?**
The agent follows a structured pipeline: input validation ‚Üí context building ‚Üí AI API call ‚Üí response parsing ‚Üí state update ‚Üí UI rendering. Each feature (study planning, quiz generation, note summarization) follows this pattern with specialized prompt engineering and error handling.

**Did you use chaining? Branching? How did you manage complexity?**
We used functional chaining through async/await patterns and implemented branching logic for error handling with fallback responses. Complexity is managed through modular functions, each handling a specific agent capability with clear separation of concerns.

### üîπ 3.4 OUTPUT GENERATOR

**Prompt:**
```
**Format your response as:**
Day 1 - [Date]
‚Ä¢ Topic: [Specific topic to study]
‚Ä¢ Activities: [List of specific activities]
‚Ä¢ Duration: [Time allocation]

Make sure the plan is comprehensive, realistic, and tailored to ${subject}.
```

**What kind of output formatting or phrasing did you aim for?**
We aimed for structured, actionable output with clear formatting that could be easily parsed by JavaScript and displayed in an intuitive UI. Each agent produces consistently formatted responses (study plans with bullet points, quizzes with Q&A format, summaries with sections).

**Any special behavior?**
Yes - we implemented markdown-style formatting, real-time loading animations, error state handling with helpful troubleshooting messages, and adaptive responses based on backend connectivity status. The output includes fallback content when AI services are unavailable.

## üîÑ SECTION 6: REFLECTION

### 6.1. What was the hardest part of this assignment?
The most challenging aspect was implementing secure API key management while maintaining a smooth user experience. Moving from frontend-only to a full-stack architecture required careful coordination between the frontend and backend, especially handling asynchronous operations, error states, and ensuring the backend remained accessible across different development environments. Additionally, switching from OpenAI to Google Gemini API required significant prompt restructuring and response format adaptation.

### 6.2. What part did you enjoy the most?
I particularly enjoyed the prompt engineering process and seeing how different prompt structures dramatically affected the quality and format of AI responses. Creating the multi-agent system where each component had a distinct personality and output format was intellectually rewarding, especially when testing edge cases and refining the prompts for better educational value. The security implementation phase was also satisfying as it transformed a simple prototype into a production-ready application.

### 6.3. If given more time, what would you improve or add?
With more time, I would implement user authentication for personalized data persistence across devices, add calendar integration for automated study reminders, create a mobile-responsive Progressive Web App (PWA), implement advanced analytics with performance trend visualization, and add collaborative features for study groups to share plans and compete on quiz scores. Voice-to-text functionality for note input would also enhance accessibility.

### 6.4. What did you learn about ChatGPT or prompt design?
I learned that specificity and structure in prompts dramatically improve output quality and consistency. Providing clear formatting requirements, context about the target audience, and explicit instructions for handling edge cases makes AI responses much more reliable. The difference between OpenAI and Google Gemini APIs also taught me about prompt portability and the importance of testing across different AI models.

### 6.5. Did you ever feel stuck? How did you handle it?
Yes, I felt stuck during the backend security implementation when environment variables weren't loading properly and during the API migration from OpenAI to Gemini. I handled this by systematically debugging each component - checking file permissions, verifying package installations, adding console logging at each step, and testing with minimal reproducible examples. Breaking complex problems into smaller, testable pieces proved essential for progress.
